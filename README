Akriti, Dic, Shari contains C++ routines for 2D polygonal collision detection, vectors, and matrices. ADS can be a good C++ project for game making, simulation or just simply learning C++. ADS is fundamentally simple where higher and complex C++ language semantics are avoided. 

The examples programs given and the header file provide information on ADS usages. The examples programs were written using SDL and SDL_gfx version 1.2 library for rendering display. The example programs can be compiled cross platform. In GNU/Linux environment with g++, the following command compiles the example programs:

g++ -I/usr/include/SDL simple_example1.cpp akriti.cpp bostu.cpp dic.cpp shari.cpp -lm -lSDL_gfx -lSDL -lSDL_ttf -o simple_example1
g++ -I/usr/include/SDL simple_example2.cpp akriti.cpp bostu.cpp dic.cpp shari.cpp -lm -lSDL_gfx -lSDL -lSDL_ttf -o simple_example2
